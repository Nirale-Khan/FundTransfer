Fund Transfer ( Banking System ) 

This is a simple Banking System project developed using Java and follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project simulates a basic banking system where users can perform various actions like creating an account, deleting an account, managing PINs, and transferring money.

Features

Create Account:  Users can create a new bank account by providing necessary details.

Delete Account:  Users can delete their existing bank accounts.

6-Digit PIN:  A 6-digit secure PIN is generated during account creation, which can be used for further operations.

Change PIN:  Users can update their account PIN when necessary.

Transfer Money:  Users can transfer money between accounts within the system.

Check Balance:  Users can view their current account balance.

Deposit/Withdraw Money:  Users can deposit or withdraw money from their accounts.

Project Structure and OOP Concepts Used

Class-Based Design:  The project uses a class-based approach to model various entities such as Bank, Account, Transaction, etc.

Encapsulation:  Account details like balance and PIN are private and can only be accessed through public methods.

Inheritance: Shared properties and methods are inherited by different classes to avoid redundancy.

Polymorphism: The system is designed to handle different banking operations dynamically.

Abstraction: Complex functionalities such as money transfer, account deletion, and PIN change are abstracted into methods for easy reuse.
